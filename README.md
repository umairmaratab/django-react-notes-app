# Project Step by Step
- Make sure you have `python3` installed.
- create a virtual enviornment with this command `python3 -m venv <environment_name>`
- Activate the enviornment with this command `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- create a django project now with `django-admin startproject backend`
- cd into backend `cd backend`
- Now we will create app inside the django project
- Use this command to install a django app, `python manage.py startapp api`
